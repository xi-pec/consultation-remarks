(Ma'am Kim)
discussed and resolved(?) issue about apps handling unknown IE data from SIGMA in the SMS payload, conclusion is that the standard defines handling unknown IE data to be ignored.
deadlines are december 13 (for Ma'am Kim) to comment, and january 6 for us to finish chapters 1-3 for final defense on around january 9.
optional, but highly recommended to create a working proof of concept of the idea before final defense.
