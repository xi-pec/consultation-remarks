- discussed and resolved(?) issue about apps handling unknown IE data from SIGMA in the SMS payload, conclusion is that the standard defines handling unknown IE data to be ignored.
- deadlines are december 13 (for Ma'am Kim) to comment, and january 6 for us to finish chapters 1-3 for final defense on around january 9.
- optional, but highly recommended to create a working proof of concept of the idea before final defense.

- goods naman
- change ordering; SMS technology first then SMS spoofing
- generalize btc example to cryptocurrency

(Sir Leo)
- already strong technicalities
- add technical diagrams
- finish synthesis and missing examples

(Sir Jax #2)
- consider using ideal path loss without obstacles in calculating signal strength instead of complex path loss with obstacles, since it is easier and is not explicitly mentioned in our study
